Delaney ML Project for Molecular Solubility Prediction
Overview
The Delaney ML Project is designed to predict the solubility of molecules, a crucial piece of information for chemists and biologists. This machine learning model utilizes a unique dataset that includes various molecular properties to determine whether a molecule is soluble in water or different solvents. This README outlines the project structure, how to set it up, and how to use the code to make predictions.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

Data Loading: The process begins by loading the solubility dataset, which includes molecular descriptors necessary for solubility prediction.

Data Preparation: Here, the dataset is prepared for modeling. This includes separating the data into features (X) and the target variable (Y), followed by splitting into training and test sets.

Model Building: Two models are explored:

Linear Regression: A basic model to establish a baseline for prediction accuracy.
Random Forest: A more complex model expected to capture non-linear relationships better.
Model Evaluation: Both models are evaluated based on their performance metrics, such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R-squared values.

Data Visualization: Visualization of prediction results to compare the actual solubility values with the predicted ones.

Setup Instructions
Environment Setup: Ensure you have a Python environment with necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib installed.

Data: The dataset should be placed in a known directory. Update the data loading section of the notebook if your dataset path differs from the default.

Running the Notebook: Open the delaney_project.ipynb in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

Usage
To use this project for your molecular solubility prediction tasks, follow these steps:

Prepare Your Dataset: Ensure your dataset follows the same format as the Delaney dataset used in this project, with appropriate molecular descriptors.

Model Training: You can train the Linear Regression or Random Forest models provided in the notebook with your dataset.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict solubility on new molecules by inputting their descriptors into the model.

Evaluation and Visualization: Evaluate the model's performance on your data and visualize the prediction results using the provided code sections.
