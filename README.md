# Delaney ML Project for Molecular Solubility Prediction

## Overview

The Delaney ML Project is designed to predict the solubility of molecules, a crucial piece of information for chemists and biologists. This machine learning model utilizes a unique dataset that includes molecular descriptors necessary for determining whether a molecule is soluble in water or different solvents. This README outlines the project structure, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading:** Initial loading of the solubility dataset.
- **Data Preparation:** Preparation of the dataset for modeling, including feature and target variable separation, followed by training and test set splitting.
- **Model Building:**
  - *Linear Regression:* Baseline model for prediction accuracy.
  - *Random Forest:* Advanced model for capturing complex patterns.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluation of models using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualization of actual vs. predicted solubility values.
